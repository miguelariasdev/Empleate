# Empleate
Free exercise assessed by the professor at school (8/10). I used Vanilla JavaScript and jQuery. It's a simple web page that consumes two APIs. One of them is used to display a map with the locations of job offers, and the other API deploys a list with all of them. Additionally, I added a search feature to make it easier to find job
